    "Furthermore, if $f$ is the linear function defined by $a$ and $g$ is the linear function defined by $b$ (*i.e.* $f(x) = ax$ and $g(y) = by$), then the function $g\\circ f$ defined by $(g\\circ f)(x) = g \\left( f(x)\\right)$ is a linear function defined by $ab$. Composition of linear functions his equivalent to multiplication of scalars.
